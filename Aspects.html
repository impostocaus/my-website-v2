            <h2>Aspects of printing</h2>
            <p>3D printing, also known as additive manufacturing, is a process of creating three-dimensional objects from a digital file. This technology builds objects layer by layer, which allows for complex shapes and structures that would be difficult or impossible to achieve with traditional manufacturing methods.</p>

            <h2>How printing works</h2>
            <h3>Design Creation:</h3>
            <p>The process begins with a digital 3D model created using Computer-Aided Design (CAD) software. Alternatively, a 3D scanner can be used to digitize an existing object. The 3D model is then converted into a format that the 3D printer can understand, typically an STL (Stereolithography) file.</p>

            <h3>Slicing:</h3>
            <p>The STL file is processed by slicing software, which divides the 3D model into thin horizontal layers. This slicing software generates a G-code file, which contains instructions for the printer, such as movement paths, speed, and material extrusion.</p>

            <h3>Printing:</h3>
            <p>The 3D printer reads the G-code file and starts building the object layer by layer. The printer deposits material (such as plastic, metal, or resin) according to the instructions, gradually creating the 3D object. There are various 3D printing technologies, each using different methods and materials to create objects.</p>
